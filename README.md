# 🎄 Terminal Christmas Forest

This is a fun little Python script I made that turns your terminal into a winter scene.  
It draws several Christmas trees (each one comes out a bit different), adds falling snow, and animates everything smoothly without flickering or messing up your scrollback.

It’s basically a cozy, looping Christmas forest right inside your terminal.


# 🌲 What it does

- Draws multiple ASCII Christmas trees along the bottom of your screen  
- Each tree is a random size (small/medium/large), so the layout changes every run  
- Snow falls straight down and lightly fills the whole screen  
- The star on each tree blinks  
- Lights on the trees change color every frame  
- Animation stays in place (it re-renders at the top instead of spamming new lines)


# ▶️ How to run it

Just clone/download the repo and run the script
